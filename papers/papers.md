# Papers for vision-based prediction
 Below are the list of vison-based prediction applications used categorize papers. For the list of papers in each category click on the name of application.
* <a href=other_papers.md>Video</a> or future scene prediction can be regarded as the most generic form of prediction.  The objective of video prediction algorithms is to generate future scenes, often in the form of RGB images.
* <a href=other_papers.md>Action</a> prediction algorithms are used to predict future activities or events given partial  or no observations of the future activities or events
* <a href=other_papers.md>Trajectory</a> prediction algorithms predict the future trajectories of objects, i.e. the future positions of the objects over time
* <a href=other_papers.md>Motion</a> prediction algorithms are those designed to predict future changes in human pose.
* <a href=other_papers.md>Other</a>  prediction includes algorithms such as visual weather prediction, occupancy grid map prediction, contest outcome prediction, etc.
