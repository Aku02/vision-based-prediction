# Contribute to this project
I intend to maintain this database by including papers for this and upcoming years. However, if you found papers missing from the list that should be included, please provide the following information and I'll do my best to include them:

* *Paper name*
* *Venue (journal, conference, etc.) it was published in*
* *Metric(s) used in the paper*
* *Dataset(s) used in the paper*
* *Links to the paper, and arxiv and code (if any). **Note**: the links for the paper should be to the original webpages of the journal or conference proceedings and/or authors' published code.

Please make sure the paper has the following characteristics:
* **Vision-based** The paper has to have a computer vision component, i.e. it should present algorithms that use vision data. The data can be either in the form of RGB, LIDAR, etc. or can be extracted from visual data such as trajectory, pose, etc.

* **Published in recognized venues** Attempts have been made to maintain a list of high quality papers that are published in recognized venues. So please do not send works that are only published as pre-print, tech reports, etc. or published in low ranking journals or conferences.
