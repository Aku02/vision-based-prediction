# Deep Learning for Vision-based Prediction
This repository serves as a reference database for the paper [Deep Learning for Vision-based Prediction: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00095.pdf). Here you can find the list of vison-based prediction papers that use **deep learning** and are published since *five years ago (ending 2019)*.

All the papers contain the following information: **datasets** (including their details) and **metrics** they use as well as corresponding **bibtex** and **links** to all published papers.

Similar to the survey paper, the papers are categorized into 5 groups: **Video**, **Action**, **Trajectory**, **Motion** and **Other** which may include applications such as visual weather forecasting, fashion trends prediction, etc.

The papers can be found in three different ways by:

* [Applications](papers.md)
* [Datasets](datasets.md)
* [Metrics](metrics.md)

### Contribution
Please feel free to submit an issue if you found missing information, incorrect links, etc.

I intend to maintain this database by including papers for this and upcoming years. However, you found a paper missing in the list that should be included the following information and I'll do my best to include them:

* *Paper name*
* *Venue (journal, conference, etc.) it was published in*
* *Metric(s) used in the paper*
* *Dataset(s) used in the paper*
* *Links to the paper, and arxiv and code (if any). **Note**: the links for the paper should be to the original webpage of the journal or conference* proceedings.

Please make sure the paper has the following characteristics:
* **Vision-based** The paper has to have a computer vision component, i.e. it should present algorithms that use vision data. The data can be either in the form of RGB, LIDAR, etc. or can be extracted from visual data such as trajectory, pose, etc.

* **Published in recognized venues** Attemps have been made to maintain a list of high quality papers that are published in recognized venues. So please do not send works that are only published as pre-print, tech reports, etc. or published in low ranking journals or conferences.
